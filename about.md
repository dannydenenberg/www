## About the site

This URL is a fairly recent addition to my personal domains. I settled on it because it is short, relevant, and allows my content to change constantly :)

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Coded on a Mac in Omaha
- Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the open source static site generator
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Using the `Operator Mono` font for code

Thanks for reading!
