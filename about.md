## About the site

This URL has been my online home for many years, manifesting at times as a blog or a portfolio until landing on this current single-column blog. Today itâ€™s a bit of an graveyard for my development-related ramblings.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Designed and coded on a Mac in Omaha
- Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the open source static site generator
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Using the `Operator Mono` font for code
